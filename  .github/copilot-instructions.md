## Instructions

Favor Simplicity: Generate straightforward and maintainable code, avoiding unnecessary complexity.​

Limit Scope of Changes: Make modifications only when explicitly requested and ensure confidence in their correctness.​

Maintain Consistency: When addressing issues, refrain from introducing new patterns or technologies that deviate from the existing codebase.​

Eliminate Redundancies: Avoid duplicating code; promote reuse through appropriate abstractions.​

Ensure Cleanliness: Keep the codebase organized and free from clutter.​

Control File Length: Aim to keep files between 200 to 300 lines; refactor larger files to enhance readability and maintainability.

Dev Environment: Windows 11, Powershell, Git. Always focus on Windows compatibility and Powershell when a shell script is required.

Do not use In Memory datastore or mock data.
